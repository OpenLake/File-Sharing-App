## About the Project <sup>[â†¥ Back to top](#table-of-contents)</sup>

### ðŸ¤” Problem  
We often need to transfer files between mobile and desktop devices. Typically, this is done using WhatsApp, Telegram, or other internet-based apps, which is inefficient for local transfers.  
This project enables **direct file sharing over an intranet** without requiring internet connectivity.  

### âœ¨ Features
- Cross-platform intranet file sharing between multiple devices.  
- Powered by **MinIO** (object storage server) for efficient file handling.  
- **Tech Stack:**  
  - **Frontend:** Flutter  
  - **Backend:** GoLang  
  - **File Storage:** MinIO  

---

## Getting Started <sup>[â†¥ Back to top](#table-of-contents)</sup>

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Go](https://go.dev) (>=1.18)  
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) (>=3.0)  
- [MinIO](https://min.io)  

---

### ðŸ“„ Running MinIO Server
1. Create a directory for MinIO:
mkdir ~/minio

2. Run the server on port **9090**:
minio server ~/minio --console-address :9090

---

### ðŸ“„ Running Backend (Go)
1. Navigate to the Go backend folder:
cd backend

2. Create a `.env` file with:
LOCAL_IP="" # Your local IP connected with minio (port 9000)
ACCESS_KEY="" # MinIO access key
SECRET_KEY="" # MinIO secret key

3. Install MinIO Go SDK if missing:
go get github.com/minio/minio-go/v7

4. Start backend:
go run file-uploader.go

---

### ðŸ“„ Running Frontend (Flutter)
1. Open the Flutter project in **Android Studio**.  
2. Update the upload/download endpoint IPs in the code with your local IP (port `8000`).  
3. Run the application:
flutter run

---

## Usage <sup>[â†¥ Back to top](#table-of-contents)</sup>

Once the setup is complete:  
- Upload files from one device via the Flutter app.  
- Files are stored in MinIO over your intranet.  
- Download files seamlessly on other connected devices.  

Example (start backend in one terminal):  
go run file-uploader.go


And then run the frontend Flutter app:
flutter run
